My name is Aditya Vijaykumar.

- I was born in **Perinthalmanna, Kerala**, but lived in **Pune, Maharashtra** till I went to college.

- I currently reside in the city of **Bengaluru, Karnataka**, where I am pursuing my PhD in Physics at the [International Centre for Theoretical Sciences](https://icts.res.in/) (ICTS-TIFR) in the [Astrophysical Relativity](https://www.icts.res.in/research/astrorel) group. If you are ever in Bengaluru and want to break away from the hustle and bustle of the city, I suggest you visit our campus to enjoy our hospitality and also learn about some interesting science being done. ICTS also has a plethora of [public events](https://icts.res.in/outreach) which you could be interested in.

- I was an undergraduate student at **Birla Institute of Technology and Science (BITS), Pilani**, where I had **Physics** and **Mechanical Engineering** as my majors. 

- I work on various physics and astrophysics aspects of gravitational waves. My work involves both theory and computation, as well as an understanding of experimental data from gravitational-wave detectors. More information about my research can be found [here](https://adivijaykumar.github.io/research/).

- Apart from academic research, I also direct and act in stage-theatre productions with the theatre outfit StageCraft ([Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/stagecraftncbs/) [Instagram](https://www.facebook.com/stagecraftncbs/)). I also run a weekly podcast called [Cut to Scene](https://linktr.ee/cuttoscene) where a friend and I discuss films.
